<h1>Assignment 4: <br>Ameliorate communication latency &amp; exploit multi-core computers</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this programming assignment is to: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Exploit multi-core processors when used as compute servers.</li>
  <li>Amerliorate communication latency.</li>
</ul>

<!--
<h2>Paper Summary</h2>

<p>
	Submit a 1-page summary, entirely in your own words, of the paper 
	"<a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/~cappello/papers/2005pdcs.html">
	Jicos: A Java-Centric Network Computing Service</a>."
</p>
-->
<h2>Specification</h2>

<h3>Design Document</h3>

<p> 
	Create a design document that briefly describes your API, if modified from Assignment 3, and your design of the infrastructural enhancements described below.  
	Identify <i>essential</i> design issues, and how your approach to them is manifested in your object-oriented design.
	Figures are welcome. 
	This should be no more than 1 or 2 pages.
</p>

<h3>Ameliorate communication latency</h3>

<p>
	Without sacrificing Computer fault-tolerance,
	enhance your infrastructure, and API, as needed, to reduce communication latency and/or overlap communication with computation.
</p>
<p>
	When JavaSpaces and ComputeFarm were designed, 
	the Space was envisioned as a shared resource among concurrent clients.
	Fair use of the Space among such clients precludes them from executing tasks on the Space.
	Since we now are in an era of cloud computing, where the [virtual] cluster is "owned" by the client, 
	the issue of fair use of the Space does not exist.
	Assuming that your design retains the Space to facilitate Computer fault-tolerance, you may wish to introduce Space-runnable tasks.
</p>
<p>
	If you choose to support space-runnable tasks, your design may assign responsibility for deciding to execute a task on the Space to the:
	</p><ul>
		<li>Application statically (at compile time), dynamically (during execution of the job), or some combination of these (e.g., defaulting to compile time)</li>
		<li>Infrastructure dynamically</li>
		<li>Some combination of the above</li>
	</ul> 

	Asymptotic analysis tells us that for some applications, if all decomposition and composition tasks are run on the Space,
	then the application's performance will be degraded.
	How does your design address this fact?
<p></p>
<p>
	Please present your thinking in your design document.
</p>
<p>
	Beyond Space-runnable tasks, one approach to overlapping task/result communication with task computation is to enable [application-directed]
	Computer Task caching and Task prefetching.
	You however may do essentially whatever you want to improve the performance of your applications by hiding communication latency 
	(i.e., overlapping computation with communication).
	<!--
	For example, you may wish to incorporate some form of work-stealing 
	(e.g., among Computer proxies on the Space or among Computers themselves).
	Can you <i>prove</i> that your system tolerates Computer faults? 
	What assumptions are needed?
	-->
</p>

<p>
	Refactor your applications, as necessary, to exploit your performance enhancing features.
	Such <i>API</i> changes, one would hope, would be minimal.
</p>

<p>
	Instrument your system so that your communication latency amelioration enhancements can be turned on or off, 
	a feature needed to perform the experiments described below.
</p>

<h3>Exploit multi-core processors when used as compute servers</h3>

<p>
	JVMs increasingly exploit multiple processors by mapping different threads to different processors.
	The <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html">java.lang.Runtime</a> method 
	<code>public int availableProcessors()</code> returns the number of processors available to the Java virtual machine.
	Let <i>T</i> be positive integer that is some function of the number of available processors.
	On each Computer, start <i>T</i> threads, each of which executes tasks.
</p>

<p>Instrument your infrastructore so that this enhancement can be turned on or off.</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>
	For all applications, do not arrange to have all tasks run on the Space;
	this eliminates parallelism and negates the assignment goal of overlapping computation with communication.
</p>

<p>
	Do the <!--Mandelbrot,--> Euclidean TSP &amp; Fibonacci number applications, with the following modifications:
	For your:
	</p><ul>
		<!--<li>Mandelbrot set visualizer, use an iteration limit of 4096.</li>-->
		<li>Fibonacci number application, compute the 20<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number;</li>
		<li>Euclidean TSP application: Use the same graph as before.
			<!--
			<ul>
				<li>Implement a stronger lower bound than the cost of a partial tour;</li>
				<li>Use the following 2D grid graph, which, by my reckoning, has a tour of size 24:</li>
			</ul>
			-->
		</li>
	</ul> 
	<!--<img src="TspGraph.png" alt="Traveling Salesman graph" title="Traveling Salesman graph" width="350px" /> -->
<p></p>

<h3>The clients</h3>

<p>Define clients that instantiate applications as done in the previous assignment.</p>

<h2>Experiments</h2>

<p>The experiment specification is the same as the previous assignment, with 2 differences:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Run with the number of computers, C = 1 and 8.</li>
    <li>For each value of C, run 4 experiments: 
      <ol>
          <li>communication latency amelioration turned off; single worker thread</li>
          <li>communication latency amelioration turned off; multiple worker threads</li>
          <li>communication latency amelioration turned on; single worker thread</li>
          <li>communication latency amelioration turned on; multiple worker threads</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
	For each application, for these 8 experiments, give 4 graphs (e.g., bar graphs) of the parallel efficiency (C = 1 vs. C = 8), 1 bar graph for each of the 4 configurations above.
	You may superimpose the 4 graphs for a particular application.
	
</p>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>
	The deliverables are the same as those for the previous programming assignment. 
	Make sure that your documents index includes or links to your:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Design document</li>
	<!--<li>Administrative information: readme and build.xml files</li>-->
	<!--<li>Javadoc of your API.</li>-->
	<li>Experimental data, presented as graphs.</li>
	<li>Explanation of your experimental data.</li>
	<li>Description of infrastructure changes that you think would further improve:
		<ul>
			<li>performance</li>
			<li>its measurement of performance.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
